Project: Undertale-Inspired Interactive Adventure Game

Description:

This project is an interactive, text-based adventure game heavily inspired by the game Undertale. The game features various scenes with unique elements, including puzzles, inventory management, and dynamic dialogues based on player actions. Players explore a maze-like environment, interact with objects, and make choices that influence the storyline.

Key Features:

Item System:

A dynamic inventory system that tracks items the player collects throughout the game. The inventory includes items with specific effects (e.g., healing items and memory fragments), each having a description and an effect when used.

Players can interact with items (such as "Snack" for healing) and view their descriptions and usability through a simple UI interface.

Maze Navigation:

A 25x25 grid maze where players navigate through tiles represented by walls and floor elements. The maze is generated with a 2D array, and the player’s movement is managed with coordinates to ensure smooth navigation.

Players can interact with different objects in the maze, including walls and doors, influencing progression through the game.

Scene Progression:

The game consists of multiple scenes (Scene 1, Scene 2, Scene 3) that are unlocked sequentially based on player actions.

Each scene has unique variables such as locked statuses, completion flags, and player interactions that determine how the story unfolds.

Dialogue System:

Players engage in dynamic dialogues that reveal aspects of the game’s lore and character development. The dialogues are displayed with a typing effect to immerse players further in the experience.

Scene 2 and Scene 3 each have their own sets of dialogues, adding depth to the storyline as players progress.

Player Stats:

The player has health points (HP), inventory slots, and a level that can increase as they progress. Various events, such as using items or interacting with objects, affect these stats.

A UI interface allows players to manage their inventory and interact with their environment effectively.

Interactive Elements:

Multiple interactive buttons and objects, such as a "Comfort" button and a "Console" button, provide additional functionality and enhance gameplay. Players can click or interact with these elements to progress or change their state within the game.

Sound Integration:

The game uses music and sound effects to create an emotional atmosphere that reflects the mood of the game, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

Technologies Used:

p5.js (for canvas rendering, animations, and interactions)

JavaScript (for game logic, item management, and scene progression)

HTML5 (for UI elements)

Instructions:

Use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze and interact with objects.

Press 'M' to open the inventory.

The game’s storyline evolves based on player choices and interactions with the environment.

Continue unlocking scenes and discovering more about the characters' backgrounds and the storyline.

Project Goal: This project aims to combine game design principles with interactive storytelling, inspired by Undertale’s unique gameplay mechanics and emotional depth. The goal is to create an engaging, story-driven adventure game that evolves based on player choices and interactions.
